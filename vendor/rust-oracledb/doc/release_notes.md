# <a name="releasenotes"></a> rust-oracledb Release Notes

## rust-oracledb 26.0.0-beta.5 (TBD)

1.  Added methods
    [Config::set_follow_redirects()](crate::Config::set_follow_redirects) and
    [Config::follow_redirects()](crate::Config::follow_redirects) (and the same
    methods on [PoolConfig](crate::PoolConfig)) to control whether a redirect
    sent by the listener is followed, and the error
    [ErrorKind::RedirectNotAllowed](crate::ErrorKind::RedirectNotAllowed).
1.  Added support for specifying the transport connect timeout and ensure it is
    actually used when establishing a connection to the database
    ([issue 35](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/35)).
1.  Fixed bug causing bind variables to be detected within DDL statements
    ([issue 33](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/33)).
1.  Fixed issue with encoding integers with trailing zeros
    ([issue 37](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/37)).
1.  Fixed bug that would cause the maximum SDU specified in all descriptions to
    be used instead of the one specified for each individual description.


## rust-oracledb 26.0.0-beta.4 (September 23, 2026)

1.  All of the database type constants have been made references in order to
    avoid the necessity of taking a reference (or a double reference when
    binding the type directly).
1.  Added methods [Metadata::data_type()](crate::Metadata::data_type()),
    [Metadata::is_sparse_vector()](crate::Metadata::is_sparse_vector()),
    [Metadata::vector_dimensions()](crate::Metadata::vector_dimensions()) and
    [Metadata::vector_dimensions()](crate::Metadata::vector_storage_format())
    and the enumeration [VectorStorageFormat](crate::VectorStorageFormat).
1.  Added new struct [StatementBuilder](crate::StatementBuilder) to capture the
    options used to build a statement and added a number of functions on the
    struct [Statement](crate::Statement) to aid in introspection.
1.  Added method [Row::columns()](crate::Row::columns()) to provide information
    about the columns found in that particular row.
1.  Added struct [DbError](crate::DbError) containing information about the
    database error which is now returned instead of `String` for
    the [ErrorKind::DbError](crate::ErrorKind::DbError) enum variant.
1.  Added support for fetching UROWID.
1.  Added support for setting the session time zone from the environment
    variable `ORA_SDTZ` or the client's local time zone
    ([issue 9](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/9)).
1.  Avoid panicing when a lock is poisoned
    ([issue 22](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/22)).
1.  Avoid building errors unless they are needed
    ([issue 28](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/28)).
1.  Added support for using the configured
    [PoolConfig::ping_timeout()](crate::PoolConfig::ping_timeout()) value
    ([issue 29](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/29)).
1.  Eliminated hang when an error occurs during a DML returning statemnt
    ([issue 16](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/16)).
1.  Fixed encoding of Oracle NUMBER data for values with an odd number of
    leading zeroes after the decimal point
    ([issue 21](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/21)).
1.  Fixed bug processing duplicate column values when the number of prefetch
    rows is greater than two
    ([issue 27](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/27)).
1.  Ensure that PL/SQL out binds can be acquired from
    [Row::get()](crate::Row::get()) and [Row::take()](crate::Row::take()) using
    the bind variable name and not just the position in the list of out binds.
1.  Ensure that connections returned from a pool always start with a call
    timeout of None.
1.  Corrected calculation of national character set ID used when creating
    temporary LOBs.


## rust-oracledb 26.0.0-beta.3 (September 8, 2026)

1.  Added methods [Row::take()](crate::Row::take()) and
    [Row::take_array()](crate::Row::take_array()) which transfer ownership of
    the data in the row to the caller. The existing methods
    [Row::get()](crate::Row::get()) and
    [Row::get_array()](crate::Row::get_array()) return references to the row
    data where possible and clone the data where an owned type is desired. The
    method ``Row::get_cursor()`` has been removed in favor of the new method
    [Row::take()](crate::Row::take()).
1.  The method [Row::get()](crate::Row::get()) can now return `&str` and
    `&[u8]` references for string and raw data respectively. This allows
    returning a reference to the fetched data without copying it.
1.  Added support for using a name instead of a numeric position to identify
    columns in [Row::get()](crate::Row::get()) and
    [Row::take()](crate::Row::take())
    ([issue 12](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/12)).
1.  Added new struct [ExecBatchResult](crate::ExecBatchResult) for getting the
    results from calling
    [Statement::execute_batch()](crate::Statement::execute_batch()) instead of
    using [ExecResult](crate::ExecResult). Methods
    [ExecResult::out_bind_data()](crate::ExecResult::out_bind_data()) and
    [ExecBatchResult::out_bind_data()](crate::ExecBatchResult::out_bind_data())
    were added for getting [PL/SQL out bind](#batchplsql) data. The methods
    [ExecResult::returned_data()](crate::ExecResult::returned_data()) and
    [ExecBatchResult::returned_data()](crate::ExecBatchResult::returned_data())
    are only used for getting [DML returning data](#dmlreturning) and they are
    returned in a manner more conducive to further manipulation
    ([discussion 14](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/discussions/14)).
1.  Added method [Connection::create_lob()](crate::Connection::create_lob) for
    creating temporary BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB values.
1.  Added support for binding long values in any order
    ([issue 10](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/10)).
1.  Added support for binding pure OUT binds using the Oracle data type instead
    of a dummy value. This also allows for binding of REF CURSOR out binds.
1.  Added support for the HA readiness requirements of Oracle Database 23.26.3.
1.  Errors that are returned now capture the backtrace and display it if
    configured with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`, which aids in debugging.
1.  Improved errors that are a result of a failure to parse the server's
    response to a request.
1.  Fixed bug where returning a connection to the pool did not end the request
    correctly
    ([issue 15](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/15)).
1.  Removed the ability to clone [Cursor](crate::Cursor) and [Lob](crate::Lob).
1.  Fixed bug which caused a named binding containing a single quote to panic.
1.  Fixed bug which caused a hang when executing a statement with PL/SQL out
    binds multiple times
    ([issue 17](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/17)).
1.  Fixed bug which caused a protocol error when parsing the response to a
    `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statement.
1.  Fixed bug which permitted a pool to be created with the maximum number of
    connections set to zero.  The error
    [ErrorKind::PoolMaxInvalid](crate::ErrorKind::PoolMaxInvalid) was renamed
    from `ErrorKind::PoolMaxLessThanMin` which now covers both scenarios.
1.  Fixed bug binding Arrow arrays of type `StringView` and `BinaryView`.


## rust-oracledb 26.0.0-beta.2 (August 20, 2026)

1.  Added method [Statement::bind_names()](crate::Statement::bind_names()) in
    order to determine the list of bind variable names used by a statement.
1.  The struct [Row](crate::Row) has been exported publicly so that
    documentation on it is visible.
1.  Added method [Row::get_array()](crate::Row::get_array()) in order to get
    values returned in a DML RETURNING statement using the same types as are
    possible with scalar values.
1.  Fixed bugs and enhanced parsing of SQL statements
    ([issue 1](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/1)).
1.  Fixed bugs and enhanced parsing of connect strings, including the handling
    of listener redirects
    ([issue 2](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/2)).
1.  Fixed bug handling multiple packet responses with databases older than
    Oracle AI Database 26ai
    ([issue 5](https://github.com/oracle/rust-oracledb/issues/5)).
1.  Fixed bugs with reading and writing CLOB/NCLOB when the database character
    set is a fixed width character set.
1.  Fixed bug when a statement is executed twice and the second time a value
    that is bound to a placeholder is larger than the value bound to that
    placeholder the first time.
1.  Fixed bug when a statement querying LOBs is executed twice and the second
    time the `fetch_lobs` option is different from the first time.
1.  String decoding now returns an error instead of panicing when invalid
    encoded string data is detected.
1.  Added runnable examples.
